## Folder sources

* SL - 1) feature-selection
* AdvML - 1) multitarget, 2) fairness, 3) imbalanced-learning
* EDS - 1) 05_feature-preprocessing, 2) 07_advanced-feature-preprocessings

## Chunks

* 01_intro (1 -> 4 chunks)
* 03_lifecycle (1 -> 2 chunks)
*  04_tuning (2 -> 4) (I have not included the i2ml .tex-s, let me know if you need me to include them as well) 
*  05_feature-preproc (1 -> 4 chunks, Rmds translated)
*  06 adv-feature-selection (2 -> 6, sl's feature selection included) 
*   07 imputation (1 -> 2 chunks, Rmds translated)
*   08_perf_calibr (1 -> 2 chunks)
*   09_imbalancy_corr (1 -> 3 chunks)
*   10_ensembles-stacking
*   11_parallelization (2 -> 3 chunks)
*   12_perf_bench
    * didn't split perf-eval-04 - it had 3 scenarios and a conclusion, having them in separate files seemed unnatural (+ the files would be too small)
    * I was unable to find the lift plot (`figure/lift_chart.png`) referenced at `slides04-perf-eval-05-practical`
*   12_time_series
*   fairness
*   feature_selection
*   multitarget (in `attic`)

## Note
- Occasionally embedded PDFs / texts don't fully fit and overlap with the footer line. I have not touched them because I'm not sure how/whether you would like me to handle them (e. g. reduce the font size, make embedded pdf smaller, paraphrase the text). Let me know if there is anything I needed to do regarding this.
- Additional notes can be found in the directories for separate chunks.
