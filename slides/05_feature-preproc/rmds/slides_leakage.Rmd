## Train-Test Leakage

```{r include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(knitr)
root = rprojroot::find_root(rprojroot::is_git_root)
ap = adjust_path(paste0(getwd(), "/figure"))
```

- Ultimately we are interested in predicting on future data!

- We can not use 'knowledge' about future (test) data during training.

- Requires clearly separating train and test data in order to avoid overoptimistic conclusions:

- **Examples:**

  - Using knowledge about which features are relevant in test data
  
  - Scaling based on statistics of the test data 
  
  - Missing patterns in the test data not present in training data
